# Html cells system

Jekyll website by cell principle.

New system to align site elements with cells.
Cells don't use CSS padding and margin to scale, but inner levels ofcourse can. 
```HTML
 <div>, <p>, <h1>, etc. and markdown.
```
Removing the need of CSS padding and margin, at the top level of the website
(This is where the cells live).


And at the same time adding functionaly that is harder to achieve with padding and margin.
Because grithub pages uses Jeklly this system is showcased using 
Jeklly.
